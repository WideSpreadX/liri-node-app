# What is Liri and What is Under the Hood

    Liri is a 'Siri' like program that is meant only to query song names and artists with the Spotify API, query upcoming concerts with the Bands In Town API and query movie information through the OMDB API.

    Liri will use Axios to get and post the data requested.

    Liri uses Moment npm for the time formatting with any dates or times used with Bands In Town.

    Finally, to keep Liri's API credentials cofindential, the UUID's and keys will be inside of the .env file which will not be visible to the public.
